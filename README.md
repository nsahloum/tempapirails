# Forecasted Temperature for locations API (Ruby on Rails)

> **Environment:**<br>
> Ruby 3.0.2 <br>
> Rails 6.1.4

## CRUD operations on locations<br>

### 1. Create location:

> POST request on: domain_name/locations?longitude=lon&latitude=lat&slug_name=location

example: domain_name/locations?longitude=4.352&latitude=50.85&slug_name=brussels
<br>
<br>**Notes:** 
- the precision of longitude and latitude is 0.001
- slug_name: name for the location thatâ€™s URL-safe
- when a location is created, the current forecasted temperatures present on 7timer.info are automatically added

### 2. Read location(s):
- List all locations:
> GET request on: domain_name/locations

- List one specific location:
> GET request on: domain_name/locations/slug_name

example: domain_name/locations/brussels

- List all forecasted temperatures for one location:
> GET request on: domain_name/slug_name

example: domain_name/brussels

### 3. Update location:

> PATCH request on: domain_name/locations/id?longitude=4.352&latitude=50.85&slug_name=brussels

example: domain_name/locations/1?longitude=4.352&latitude=50.85&slug_name=brussels

**Note:**
- You can get the id of a location by listing one specific location (see above)

### 4. Delete location:

> DELETE request on: domain_name/slug_name

## Filter forecasted temperatures by dates:
### 1. Between two dates
> GET request on: domain_name/location?start_date=""&end_date=""<br>

date format: YYYY-MM-DD <br>
example: domain_name/brussels?start_date=2021-07-19&end_date=2021-07-20

### 2. All forecasted temperatures from a start date:
> GET request on: domain_name/location?start_date=""

### 3. All forecasted temperatures before an end date:
> GET request on: domain_name/location?end_date=""

## Synchronize data from 7Timer API (adding new forecasted temperatures)

### 1. Synchronize all locations temperatures:

> POST request on: domaine_name/synchronize

#### Create a CRON job on this url
- example of CRON job on localhost to synchronize data every days at 18:30 :<br>
> 30 18 * * * /usr/bin/curl -X POST http://127.0.0.1:3000/synchronize

### 2. Synchronize one specific location

> POST request on: domaine_name/synchronize?location=slug_name

example: domaine_name/synchronize?location=brussels

## Errors and info handeling

> ERROR:1 : This location already exists

ERROR:1 Explanation : 
- if a user try to create a location with a slug_name that already exists

> ERROR:2 : You must specify a valid longitude, latitude and a slug_name

ERROR:2 Explanation : 
- if a user don't specify all the three parameters (longitude, latitude and slug_name) 
- or a user enter a non-valid longitude (must be between -180 and 180) or latitude (must be between -90 and 90)

> ERROR:3 : No forecasted temperatures saved for this location

ERROR:3 Explanation : 
- if a user ask for location that doesn't have forecasted temperatures 
- Note : forecasted temperature are added when location is created but maybe if there is no connection with the 7Timer API at this moment we can get this error

> ERROR:4 : No forecasted temperatures saved for this date

ERROR:4 Explanation : 
- if a user ask for forecasted temperatures before the date of creation of the location in the database 
- because it's impossible to get past forecasted temperature in 7Timer but this API can store the data starting from location's date of creation.

> INFO: Synchronization successfully done

Explanation : when the synchronization of one location or all locations is done
